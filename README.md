### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Luke! As a Digital Learning Engineer at the Ted Wragg Trust, I operate closely with teaching staff across the trust to design and develop empowering solutions for the classroom that embraces technology. With a substantial focus on automation, my role strives to reduce the time spent by teachers manually uploading and creating content on learning management systems.

I'm a massive advocate for emerging technologies such as serverless computing, machine learning, and cloud computing, and look to integrate them into the classroom whenever and wherever possible.
